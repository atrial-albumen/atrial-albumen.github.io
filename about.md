I'm a pianist and a worship pastor living it up in Greenville, SC.

I have a B.A. in Music Performance from North Greenville University, where I studied with Mr. Fabio Parrini, and I recently completed my Masters of Music in Piano Performance from Converse University, where I studied with Dr. Steven Graff.

I am passionate about bridging classical and contemporary music traditions through holistic teaching for growing well-rounded musicians.

When I'm not playing piano, find me daytripping to the mountains, sipping coffee, writing poetry, or [birding](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-difference-between-bird-watching-and-birding).
