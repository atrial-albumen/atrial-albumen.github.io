I'm a pianist and a worship leader living it up in Greenville, SC.

I've got a B.A. in Music Performance from North Greenville University with Mr. Fabio Parrini.

Currently I'm working on my M.M. in Piano Performance from Converse University, studying with Dr. Steven Graff, with dreams of doctoral school and teaching.

In my free time, I like to go to the mountains with my family, write poems, and go [birding](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-difference-between-bird-watching-and-birding).
