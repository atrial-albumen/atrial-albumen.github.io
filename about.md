I'm a pianist and a worship leader, among other things.

I've got a B.A. in Music Performance from North Greenville University, where I studied with Fabio Parrini.

Currently I'm working on my M.M. from Converse University, studying with the great Dr. Steven Graff.

I live in South Carolina and want to teach music theory and piano some day.

In my free time, I like to go to the mountains with my family, write poems, and go birding.
