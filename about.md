I'm a pianist and a worship pastor living in Greenville, SC.

In 2021, I graduated suma cum laude with a B.A. in Music Performance from North Greenville University, where I studied with Mr. Fabio Parrini. In 2024, I completed my Masters of Music in Piano Performance from Converse University, where I studied with Dr. Steven Graff.

I am passionate about bridging classical and contemporary piano music traditions through holistic piano instruction to cultivate well-rounded musicians.

When I'm not playing piano, find me daytripping to the mountains, sipping coffee, writing poetry, or [birding](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-difference-between-bird-watching-and-birding).
