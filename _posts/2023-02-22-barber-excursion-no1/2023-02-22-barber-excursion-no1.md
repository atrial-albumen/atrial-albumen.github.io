description: A closer look into Samuel Barber's first Excursion.
---

Recently, I've had the joy of expanding my repertoire into the 20th century with some good ditties by the American neo-Romantic composer Samuel Barber (1910-1981). 

Excursions, Op.20, is a set of four pieces of American style written for piano. [Jeanne Behrend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Behrend), an accomplished American pianist and friend of Barber's, asked the composer to write an involved piano work that would "would be appropriate to perform on one of her programs of American music."[^1] So along came _Excursions_ in 1942.

_Excursions, Op.20_ opens with the following note from the composer:
> These are ‘Excursions’ in small classical forms into regional American idioms. Their rhythmic characteristics, as well as their source in folk material and their scoring, reminiscent of local instruments are easily recognized.

I'd encourage you to [have a listen](https://youtu.be/ZDatkOhDaVo) so the following ramble makes some sense...

There has been some analysis done on these pieces, and I have learned from others' studies, but I think I've come on an original discovery relating to the first movement.

But first, here's some brief(ish) thoughts on the piece. If you look back at the above quote, Barber almost makes it too easy on us to get started on the analysis. He gives us the following things to look for:
* A small classical form
* Regional American idioms

In a 1957 dissertation, Russell Friedewald identifies the classical form as a five-part rondo, using the pitch collections of the (incessant) left-hand ostinato to identify formal sections.[^3] It gets _way_ cooler, though, than rondo form...

In his 1954 book on Samuel Barber, Nathan Broder identifies the first movement (which bears the sexy title of _I. Un poco allegro_) as a boogie-woogie.[^2] According to Collins English Dictionary, a boogie-woogie "a blues-based style of jazz piano playing in which insistently repeated bass figures employing eighth notes accompany melodic variations in the treble."

Makes sense after listening to the piece, yeah? Here's the "A section" ostinato, C being the dominant tone:

Boogie-woogies are _usually_ in 12-bar blues form, and blues harmonic progression is some variant of I-IV-I-V-I. So it's unsurprising that Barber would use this chord progression to provide the bass for each section of the "rondo". But wait—there's more!

This first "excursion" is actually proportionate to 12-bar blues. If you scale the blue up nine times (not play the form nine times, but actually "enlarge" it), you find that this movement maps pretty neatly onto 

As for some other American idoms that you can find in this movment, ...
