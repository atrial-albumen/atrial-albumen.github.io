description: A closer look into Samuel Barber's first Excursion.
---

Recently, I've had the joy of expanding my repertoire into the 20th century with Samuel Barber's Excursions. 

Excursions, Op.20, is a set of four pieces of American style written for piano. [Jeanne Behrend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Behrend), an accomplished American pianist and friend of Barber's, asked the composer to write a more involved piano work that would "would be appropriate to perform on one of her programs of American music."[1] So along came _Excursions_.

_Excursions_ opens with the following note from the composer:
> These are ‘Excursions’ in small classical forms into regional American idioms. Their rhythmic characteristics, as well as their source in folk material and their scoring, reminiscent of local instruments are easily recognized.

I'd encourage you to [have a listen](https://youtu.be/ZDatkOhDaVo) so the following ramble makes some sense...

There has been some analysis done on these pieces, and I borrow from others' studies, but I think I've come on an original discovery relating to the first movement.

In his 1954 book on Samuel Barber, Nathan Broder identifies the first movement (which bears the sexy title of _I. Un poco allegro_) as a boogie-woogie.[2] According to Collins English Dictionary, a boogie-woogie "a blues-based style of jazz piano playing in which insistently repeated bass figures employing eighth notes accompany melodic variations in the treble."
