description: A closer look into Samuel Barber's first Excursion.
---

If I were to confine myself to a period of classical music, without hesitation it would be to the late Romantic period. Composers like Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Brahms—they fill my practice time. Personally, I like to think of Debussy as the very tail end of the late Romantics. His music's emotive like the composers before him, rather than after him, despite his harmonic language.

But you won't find many pieces in my repertoire that travel along the classical music timeline and past Debussy. It's nothing personal, just that my teachers have not been interested in anyone after Prokofiev. Enter Samuel Barber.

Studying with Dr. Steven Graff of Converse University has been a real joy. I'm developing better practicing habits. I'm practicing more in my life. He's showing me how to develop more musically, not just technically. Looking at my rep list, he offered some pieces, one of which was Barber's _Excursions, Op.20_. Weird stuff, I thought. Gotta learn it, I told Dr. Graff.
